# colorizer

This is a fun competition to color images.  

The python script color.py is scaffolding code to automatically load images of flower in black and white and try to learn a network to predict the original color image.  We download some validation data to a directory called test, please don't modify that directory. 

You are welcome to use other ML architectures besides keras, but please use *wandb.log({"loss": loss})* so that we can see your performance.
